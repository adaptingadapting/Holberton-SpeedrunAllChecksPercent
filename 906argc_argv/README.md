README for the argc argv project

task 0 i maaged to do pretty quickly, argc and argv is a pretty easy topic.

task 1 i think requires printf for now, you could pass numbers so big to main that its impractical and outside the scope of this excercise to code with putchar

task 2 was rather simple, and i am abstaining from using printf as much as i can, in the past projects i used it very liberally, i mean before the speedrun

task 3 i did with my own atoi function, it has admiteddly limited range so thats on me but the function in task 3 itslef is fine

task 4 was an easy one i think, i forgot about the readme back then but it was simple enough

task 100 was a cute function to think about thats nice to get it finally and now on to the next project
