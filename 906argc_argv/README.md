README for the argc argv project

task 0 i maaged to do pretty quickly, argc and argv is a pretty easy topic.

task 1 i think requires printf for now, you could pass numbers so big to main that its impractical and outside the scope of this excercise to code with putchar

task 2 was rather simple, and i am abstaining from using printf as much as i can, in the past projects i used it very liberally, i mean before the speedrun
