README for the function pointers project

task 0 is a classic warmup task, now that im good with these it was a breeze

task 1 as well, im ready for printf now honestly these little projects are below me!!, atlhough the last task in this one was the first task i didnt do last timrester, leaving the projecrt at 69% instead of the usual hundred

task 2 im warming up baby, finished this one in speedy fashion and im only getting faster, im on a roll

task 3 there was a huge hangup in the third task, basically the * is expankding into the names of files and i feel like that is trolling me a little bit i have to say. my function looks similar to others ive seen round so i dont think im making a huge mistake, maybe just making an oversight. thing is this is making me feel a little trolled and took me down, i think i am done for the day
