README for the variadic functions directory

task 0: was easy as these first tasks usually are, i would argue that variadic functions are not that hard

task 1: im slowing down now because im trying to get away from two finger typing, its going to be a long road but i imagine myself in the futrue with a comfortable 100wwpm rate and that motivates me

task 2: simmilar to task 1, working around strings is always a little daring, but with experience you lose the fear and so i delcare a pointer and dont malloc it or anything, dont need to and just throw it there and it works, very nice

task 3 added task 3, now complying with the for loop and if else requirments finally, one more task (advanced) and im off to printf

task 100 required assembly, its nice to do a little hello woelrd project in assembly, and i thought it would be scarier honestly, my goal for next year is to develop something with assembly
