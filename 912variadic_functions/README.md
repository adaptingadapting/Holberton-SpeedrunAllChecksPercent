README for the variadic functions directory

task 0: was easy as these first tasks usually are, i would argue that variadic functions are not that hard

task 1: im slowing down now because im trying to get away from two finger typing, its going to be a long road but i imagine myself in the futrue with a comfortable 100wwpm rate and that motivates me

task 2: simmilar to task 1, working around strings is always a little daring, but with experience you lose the fear and so i delcare a pointer and dont malloc it or anything, dont need to and just throw it there and it works, very nice
