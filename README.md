This repo is for speedrunning the first three months of alx, each project
and repo will have its own folder inside of which there will be the tasks

day 7 and 8: i finidhes ddoubly linked lists and hash tables and im set up to do the shell project, hash tables reminded me of bit manipulation in how even if its a little new it was still entertaining (more so than doubly linked lists at least).

day 6: after a little break for christmas im back stronget than even, i completed singly and more singly linked lists justs now and im ready for bit manipulation which im starting, should be done in a few hours and getting ready to crush the doubly linked lists project

day 5: today i only completed two projects, variadic functions and printf, but t
his was to be expected i think, i think two projects per day is a reasonable goal now, printf took me around 2 hours so that is good, on to linked lists

day 4: day four was the day with the least amount of commits, this pattern has repeated for 3 days straight, but i think this pattern will stop now as i get to a steady normal difficulty, every day will have a similar amount of commits. today i worked on function pointers and in the last task of the project i had an issue where the operator for multipllication "*" expanded before entering the funvtion so argv[2] would be replaced by the names of files instead of just a "*" character

day 3: it contained less commits than the first two days, but it was not beacause of laziness i feel, the tasks were harder and i had not done some of the advanced takss presented to me. still, i managed 60 commits and like 50 tasks so im not too sad

day 2: it was slower than the other days naturally, especially since i did some advanced tasks that i had not touched in the past, its going to get only slower from here

day 1: already finished the first 8 projects and got into c, by tommorrow i should be at pointers already

day 0: its only been around 2 hours of "working" and ive already blazed past
5 projects, its only getting harder now"
