This repo is for speedrunning the first three months of alx, each project
and repo will have its own folder inside of which there will be the tasks

day 3: it contained less commits than the first two days, but it was not beacause of laziness i feel, the tasks were harder and i had not done some of the advanced takss presented to me. still, i managed 60 commits and like 50 tasks so im not too sad

day 2: it was slower than the other days naturally, especially since i did some advanced tasks that i had not touched in the past, its going to get only slower from here

day 1: already finished the first 8 projects and got into c, by tommorrow i should be at pointers already

day 0: its only been around 2 hours of "working" and ive already blazed past
5 projects, its only getting harder now"
