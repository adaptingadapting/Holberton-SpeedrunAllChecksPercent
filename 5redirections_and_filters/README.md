This one was tough, it has the nasa exericse and some other tedious ones

task 0 is just the echo command, good to know though

task 1 was trickier before, but i had to do it for the mock interview

task 2 ive used cat quite a bit these last three months, i will do it once more

task 3 just add one argument to task 2

task 4 using the tail command for this

task 5 is easy, use head for this one instead of tail

task 6 is a combination of head and tial with their respective line flags

task 7 is tricky, for now the task that has taken me the longest

task 8 slows down and goes for a new functionality, in this case ">"

task 9 is a combo of tail and >

task 10 man find is very long and tedious, but read it all anyways

task 11 in task 11 we use a wc -l to count the lines output of find

task 12 we go back to lse

task 13 i forgot about adding the -u flag to uniq for a while, that was embarassing

task 14 again is easier, jsut use grep and win

task 15 just use the c flag for the grep command and you got it, things are going to get harder soon, pray for me

task 16 is again easy just use the flag for the grep command

task 17 another grep flag, this is getting trivial

task 18 use one of the character classes for this one

task 19 can use tr multiple ways, i chose a double pipe setup, not the most efficient

task 20 is just the same as 19

task 21 is just using the rev command

task 22 uses cut for the first time and its going to be useful in the following excercises

task 23 was very hard the first time i tried, i did it faster now obviously
