This one was tough, it has the nasa exericse and some other tedious ones

task 0 is just the echo command, good to know though

task 1 was trickier before, but i had to do it for the mock interview

task 2 ive used cat quite a bit these last three months, i will do it once more

task 3 just add one argument to task 2

task 4 using the tail command for this

task 5 is easy, use head for this one instead of tail

task 6 is a combination of head and tial with their respective line flags

task 7 is tricky, for now the task that has taken me the longest
