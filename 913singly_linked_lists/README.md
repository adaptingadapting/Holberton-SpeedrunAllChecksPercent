readme for the singly linked lists project

task 0 i done, im honestly not super excited but at the same time linked lists are important so ill do these ones dilligently, for this first task, i forgot to not Å•int lenght when string was null and thats about the only real complexity of this, but its done and im off to the next task

task 1 im a little afraid of advancing the head pointer that they are supplying me if i am honest, but surely this cannot be too bad

task 2 was more of the same, lets see if this gets harder ever

task 3 was a pain, kept getting segfault over and over, thing is i was missing in the if head doesnt exist case to specify that head was a pointer, it was compiling fine but at runtime it would never execute so it was tricky, i though maybe i needed some weird malloc but no, i did not

task 4 is coded fine but my programs still lose some memory, i chuck it up to task 3 where i made a mess, i will get better though
