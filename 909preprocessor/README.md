README for the preprocessor directory

task 0 is a one line file so thats not bad, im ready for printf already

task 1 i managed to achieve a slight efficiency gain by using ifndef how its intended instaad of defining a useless term and then going on to define pi, i just use ifned pi define pi and it should be fine

task 2 was rather simple again, not much complexity possible with these macro taks to be fair

task 3 the syntax is kind of interesting thats the only real hard part but otherwise still rather simple, i tried doing it without any of these () and it worked but i put them out of out respect for the reader, like everyone lse does
