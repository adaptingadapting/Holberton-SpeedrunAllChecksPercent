README for project more malloc free

task 0 is done, it does return a valgrind error but there are not maany other ways to do this task.

task 1 is just a copy paste of str cat but with a caveat of i < n, took me around 2 minutes

task 2 i was trying to get away from using memset so i did by declaring void p as char * and then setting it to null by hand, good stuff
