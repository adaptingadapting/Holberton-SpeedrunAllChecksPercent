readme file for functions nested loops, this one is quite easy

task 0 is quite troll considering the knowledge you would have at this point, the only way would be to di it putchar by putchar which again is pretty milky

task 1 is something weve already done so thats simple

task 2 is a simple nested loop

task 3 was kind of simple, i for one moment put an || operator instead of a && operator and got it wrong, thats why you check your code boys

task 4 was very simple, just remember that uppercase chars have a lower asci number as lowercase ones
