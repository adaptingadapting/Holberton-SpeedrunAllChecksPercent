readme file for functions nested loops, this one is quite easy

task 0 is quite troll considering the knowledge you would have at this point, the only way would be to di it putchar by putchar which again is pretty milky

task 1 is something weve already done so thats simple

task 2 is a simple nested loop

task 3 was kind of simple, i for one moment put an || operator instead of a && operator and got it wrong, thats why you check your code boys

task 4 was very simple, just remember that uppercase chars have a lower asci number as lowercase ones

task 5 was a little tedious but doable, simple though

task 6 is very simple, the fact that there is such a function is kinda funny but its understandable, we dont want to make our own

task 7 first time combining multiple functions, this time abs and putchar and thats it

task 8 is done with the modulus thing again, good enoguh

task 9 was quite tricky actually, took me a while but its done, especially that fraaking spaces thing is annoyinh

task 10 was quite a change of pace, a one line function

task 11 was kind of funny , ithink my old try was better looking even, but whatever

task 100 i decided to not add the commas just because it looks better this way, i wont upload it anyways so i just know that i did it and that thats the only missing part

task 101 is quite simple i have to say,  so thats good

task 102 i have a feeling  i did this one in a not so efficient manner, but its donee and its not like i trolled horribly, could ahve done better though
