Emacs is my goto choice for text editor. i use it exclusively to code
i will defend emacs to the death.
this repo brings good memories to me and i will do it with pleasure for the speedrun, im not looking forward to the next project "vim" :/

task 0 is about creating a dir in root called emacs, we did it in the first project so there is not much to explain
task 1 is about opening a file from emacs, something ive done countless times, easy money
