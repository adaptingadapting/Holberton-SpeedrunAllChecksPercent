Emacs is my goto choice for text editor. i use it exclusively to code
i will defend emacs to the death.
this repo brings good memories to me and i will do it with pleasure for the speedrun, im not looking forward to the next project "vim" :/

task 0 is about creating a dir in root called emacs, we did it in the first project so there is not much to explain
task 1 is about opening a file from emacs, something ive done countless times, easy money
task 2 is about saving, like last time ive done it thousands of times, keep them coming
task 3 is about cutting, easy hit control k
task 4 is about pasting, even tho there is no such thing i guessed they ment yanking and put on c y
task 5 i dont search as often as i do other things, but i still know its control s
