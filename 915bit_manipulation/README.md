README for the bit manipulation project

task 0 solutions is so beautiful, i had actually made up an elevatinvg algorithm in my mind and a super complicated sulution unrelated to bitshifting and then i see the actual intended way and it came down on me like a hammer, what an elegant elegant solution that incorporates a lot of common sense that i had applied to the other one but in a common way instead of a highly complicated one, as an example, you are shifting res to the left always, but it doesnt matter until you find the first '1', i had come up with a solution for that that nescessitated a function and like 2 ifs, the way it worked in the end is a simple or operator in the current bit which is of course much cleaner, that is just one of the many ways this solution really exploded my try into a thousand pieces. on to task 1, i might do that one without help now thanks to this
