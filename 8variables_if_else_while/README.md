now going into variables and if else while im feeling pretty good, i think the challeenge will start around bit manipulation maybe then ill spend some time

task 0 is simple enough, like i expected. these first few projects are very milky

task 1 was long again which is fine just unfortunate now

task 2 i went for a much cleaner solution now, so thats good

task 3 is just copy paste not really much to say

task 4 again i did it in a fancier way now, with a not logical statemenet

task 5 is up for choice, i used putchar but apparently you can use printf

task 6 ok its literally the same code as last time, thats funny

task 7 easy as well, nothing to really comment

task 8 is simple copy pasting and chaning 1 or two things, thats been this whole directory really

tasl 9 is confusing with its wording, what does combination of single digit numbers mean

task 100 was good, i did it much more efficiently this time around

task 101 its just funny how much more clean my code looks compared to the old one, and how much more efficient and elegant it is, even though both are hardcode this one is just so much more slick, im embarassed of the other code pretty much. but its nice that i tried back then, and nicer that i got it down

task 102 forced me to change my aproach to somehting a little less desirable really but maybe clearer and more efficient, it is a shame the other method is so cumbersome because i like it more
