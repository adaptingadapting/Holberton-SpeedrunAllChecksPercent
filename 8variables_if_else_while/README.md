now going into variables and if else while im feeling pretty good, i think the challeenge will start around bit manipulation maybe then ill spend some time

task 0 is simple enough, like i expected. these first few projects are very milky

task 1 was long again which is fine just unfortunate now

task 2 i went for a much cleaner solution now, so thats good

task 3 is just copy paste not really much to say

task 4 again i did it in a fancier way now, with a not logical statemenet

task 5 is up for choice, i used putchar but apparently you can use printf

task 6 ok its literally the same code as last time, thats funny

task 7 easy as well, nothing to really comment
