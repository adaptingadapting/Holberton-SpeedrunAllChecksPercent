RAEDME file for the doubly liked lists directoy

task 0 was rather simple as usual for these 0 tasks, im wondering if its nescessary to go back to the first node with the prev since i didnt do the in the first one, but i did this time and it works and its probably cleaner, on to task 2

task 1 again i did the backing up to the first node of the list, i dont know if its super milky but whatever, i like to think it would be useful somewhere

task 2 i did in the exact same way really, at first i got segfault due to a faulty malloc so that forced me to do it the right way, and a simple right way it is

task 3 im back again after a day of doing nothing, truth is doubly linked lists is not exactly the most excitiing thing but il finish today, task 3 itself is nice, the thing i remember from the singly linked lists is always to save a copy of the head pointer in another variable when you get the double pointer to head.
then you advance this pointer and add one at the end

task 4 was very simple, literally the same as the four on the singly linked lists project. the recursion idea is the best for anything that requieres you to do things in reverse like freeing a linked list

task 5 was a little troll, but im happy with what i did as i think its a lot cleaener and better fits with the rest of my work, last time i did it it was a one off milky gimmick solution, so this time i step back from index by one and then i return the next pointer, it has to be genius
