RAEDME file for the doubly liked lists directoy

task 0 was rather simple as usual for these 0 tasks, im wondering if its nescessary to go back to the first node with the prev since i didnt do the in the first one, but i did this time and it works and its probably cleaner, on to task 2

task 1 again i did the backing up to the first node of the list, i dont know if its super milky but whatever, i like to think it would be useful somewhere

task 2 i did in the exact same way really, at first i got segfault due to a faulty malloc so that forced me to do it the right way, and a simple right way it is
