first c project, im glad honestly, even though the shell projects were a breeze
its still nice to be back where ive spent most of the time these past few months

task 0 i did it with a pipe last time funnily enough but this time i used the intended -o flag for gcc

task 1 i did with the other flag for gcc, although ive never used them outside these excericeses i still somewhat remember their existence

task 2 is just copy paste with another flag, im gonna use this flag later to learn assembler tho, nice to know

task 3 now only the -o flag is needed, a downgrade in difficulty from the first excersice

task 4 is rather simple i have to say, but i cant see how it was necessary when we were just starting

task 5 is just about using printf, simple as last time but cool that we had trouble doing this once and now its so easy

task 6 this one is fine, if not a little tedious now that i know how to use printf already, but its fine

task 7 was interesting, i just remembered the whole write thing, even though its never explicited i found it back then, and its nice that you have to go looking for once to solve one of these, not like i did that now but back then
