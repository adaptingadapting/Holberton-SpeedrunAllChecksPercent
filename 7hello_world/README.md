first c project, im glad honestly, even though the shell projects were a breeze
its still nice to be back where ive spent most of the time these past few months

task 0 i did it with a pipe last time funnily enough but this time i used the intended -o flag for gcc

task 1 i did with the other flag for gcc, although ive never used them outside these excericeses i still somewhat remember their existence

task 2 is just copy paste with another flag, im gonna use this flag later to learn assembler tho, nice to know

task 3 now only the -o flag is needed, a downgrade in difficulty from the first excersice

task 4 is rather simple i have to say, but i cant see how it was necessary when we were just starting
