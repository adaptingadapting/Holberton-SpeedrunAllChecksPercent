first c project, im glad honestly, even though the shell projects were a breeze
its still nice to be back where ive spent most of the time these past few months

task 0 i did it with a pipe last time funnily enough but this time i used the intended -o flag for gcc

task 1 i did with the other flag for gcc, although ive never used them outside these excericeses i still somewhat remember their existence
