this folder is about this new shell basics project, looking forward to it

task 0 is fairly basic, print the working directory with pwd

task 1 is more of the same basic stuff, ls prints the contents of the cwd

task 2 is about changing dir to home, easy with cd /home or just cd

task 3 lists in long format with ls -l flag

task 4 lists in long format with hidden files adding the -a flag
