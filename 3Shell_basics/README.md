this folder is about this new shell basics project, looking forward to it

task 0 is fairly basic, print the working directory with pwd

task 1 is more of the same basic stuff, ls prints the contents of the cwd

task 2 is about changing dir to home, easy with cd /home or just cd

task 3 lists in long format with ls -l flag

task 4 lists in long format with hidden files adding the -a flag

task 5 had to do a read up on the man page for this one, its the n flag

task 6 i thought of doing cd then creating but you can do it just with mkdir

task 7 is just move, simple

task 8 is just a remove command

task 9 in this one we use the -r flag of the rm command that removes directories and their contents recursively

task 10 task 10 is unironically tricky

task 11 is back to being simple, just ls and then the dirs in order

task 12 is about using file

task 13 is tricky aswell, i had forgotten about the ln command

task 14 just do the -n flag of the cp command, easy money

task 15 is about moving using the upper keyword

task 16 is pretty useful, but rather simple
