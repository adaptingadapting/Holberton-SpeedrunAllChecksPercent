README for the hash tables repo

task 0 was interesting, i had forgotten to malloc the array and when i got the idea to do it i had doubts on how much to actually alloc to it, in the end i went for size times nodes which makes sense, if you have an array of 2 that means that there should be space for two nodes so yeah

task 1 bruh

task 2 again is a one line thing, even "simpler" than task 1 if that is even possible, the thing about task 2 is that it does somewhat require some undesrstanding of hash tables, lucky for me i thought of the solution in very short time again

task 3 i dont even remember, appraently i didnt do the reacme for it, anyways

task 4 was okay, it was between very easy and interesting, im getting better and better at hash tables
