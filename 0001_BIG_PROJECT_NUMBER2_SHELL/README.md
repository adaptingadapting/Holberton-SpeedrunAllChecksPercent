The speedrun is coming to an end, it took me longer than expected to get here but that is fine, lets see what we can do with this shell project on our own, the part that i remember the most was having finished everything apparently but getting 0 points because i hadnt done the exit status or error managment nesscesary.
so i will take care of those things from the start as i begin this new project

in day one i advanced quite far, i "tried" (succeeded) to used linked lists for something but since execve takes arrays of strings that felt silly, still im keeping that. everything else is pretty similar, this time i did build an env builtin and i have sliightly changed the flow of the program, still needs work on error and memory managment but its on the right track
