readme for malloc free dir

task 0 was very simple, and this code is much shorter and cleaner than the old one, what im wondering is if this would pass bettys checks, but whatever

task 1 i forgot about adding the null byte again sadly so it took me around 10 minutes more than it should have, still i managed in a reasonable time

task 2 im pretty sure this should be fine fine fine so yeah, nice that i got it first try

task 3 took me a while, truth is i need to get better with some of these matrix problems but i did fine
