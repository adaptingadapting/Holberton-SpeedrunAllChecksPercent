README file for the recursion project

task 0 was funny because i didnt initialize the i so i waas getting segfault for no reason but ok i solved it quickly, on to harder tasks

task 1 i delcared a variable for seemlingly no reason, even though if i remoeved it i got a segfault, im going to keep on going now...

task 2 was simple enough, the thing that cost me the most was the adding one paart but it was still a swift task

task 3 cost me quite a bit, i didnt want to add the > 1 caveat to the code as i felt it was a little hardcodey but i couldnt see another way

task 4 was funny in that i added return 1 to fix one case and it fixed everything else, that was pretty convenient i have to say

task 5 was the first time you had to create a secondary function i think and okay i did it again this time

task 6 final task of the day, felt good to do it without help and stuff, recursion is definetively rarely used but still it is good to know to do these things at least somewhat
