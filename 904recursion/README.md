README file for the recursion project

task 0 was funny because i didnt initialize the i so i waas getting segfault for no reason but ok i solved it quickly, on to harder tasks

task 1 i delcared a variable for seemlingly no reason, even though if i remoeved it i got a segfault, im going to keep on going now...

task 2 was simple enough, the thing that cost me the most was the adding one paart but it was still a swift task

task 3 cost me quite a bit, i didnt want to add the > 1 caveat to the code as i felt it was a little hardcodey but i couldnt see another way
