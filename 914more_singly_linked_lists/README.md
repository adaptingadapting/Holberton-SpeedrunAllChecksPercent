README for the more s linked lists project

task 0 is a simpler version of the first excercise of the last one, playing with the  head pointer gives me a little bit of a bad taste still but ok, i dont see any other way to do it

task 1 again was rather simple, i do know that they are going to get harder soon enough so im not sad to see these at the start, task 1 requieres even less work than the already trivial task 0
