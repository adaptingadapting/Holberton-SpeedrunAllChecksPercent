README for the more s linked lists project

task 0 is a simpler version of the first excercise of the last one, playing with the  head pointer gives me a little bit of a bad taste still but ok, i dont see any other way to do it

task 1 again was rather simple, i do know that they are going to get harder soon enough so im not sad to see these at the start, task 1 requieres even less work than the already trivial task 0

task 2 was fast, the thing that caught me up was, in my original project back then i returned a pointer to head, so that does seem strange to me, i did play more with that head but im still wondering if this one would pass through the checks

task 3 has a few nuances, like you need to create the list if it doesnt exist and also, you have to traverse the list in the correct way, overall it was fine and im ready for some harder ones

task 4 forced me to fix tasks 3 errors and im glad for that, turns out to allco memory for a node you have to go the listint t route instead of the name of the node, that took down my errors from around 90 to 0

task 5 i used the previous function in this one for the sake of not having to do it again

task 6 i did something strange in the older version, for some reason i equaled the pointer to the next one twice? i dont know why, this version should work and of course its cleaaner and better
