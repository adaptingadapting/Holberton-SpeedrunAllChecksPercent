im not sure we evem had to make files for this project, but i will pretend we
did anyways. im just going to make scripts to run the tasks assigned

task 0 should take you to root with cd /root and create an empty file using touch
task 1 should take you to root like before and this time we copy the file with cp into /tmp
task 2 is about a new functionality of mv, that of renaming files
task 3 again we need to use the move command, this time conventionally to move to another directory, fairly easy
task 4 uses a new command, the rm or remove one.
