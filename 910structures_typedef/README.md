README for the structures typedef dir

task 0 is just defining a structure in a header, shouldnt be too hard. it was the first time i did it though, thats good that ive improved so much

task 1 its not clear what to do if we are passed a null struct but otherwise just set the structs paramenters with the ones you are given

task 2 im wondering if there is an easier way of achieving this. this code is the same as the old one and its pretty good, but there might be a way to be better

task 3 is a one line task, just typedef either struct dog or just the typedefed dog as dog_t

task 4 i managed to do, there is the fear of missing an edge case since im not sending anything to the checks in the back of my mind but im doing well i think, especially because once i finish a task i go back and check how i did before so i dont think im missing anything big

task 5 is done, it comes with a valgrind conditional jumpp baeed on a non init value but ill take it
