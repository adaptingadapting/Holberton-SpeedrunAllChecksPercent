readme for the readme project
task 0 is simple, these commands are all quite similar though

task 1 for this one looking at the tile is enoguh, a whoami command

task 2 was not that hard either, there is a groups command after all

task 3 in this one we use a new command called chown, change owner

task 4 weve already done this before, just use touch

task 5 was trickier before, now just do +x and its done

task 6 is just another chmod add one

task 7 even easier than last

task 8 i remember when lucas cobham made a joke about the name of the task, shoutout to him

task 9 is another chmod set

task 10 just read the manual (for chmod)

task 11 adds with the -R flag of chmod

task 12 a new flag for mkdir this time its -m for mode

task 13 just chgrp

task 14 cute flag for chown

task 15 is a little confusing, whether it is a symbolic link or not doesnt really matter, it should tell you what it wants you to do to the file instead
