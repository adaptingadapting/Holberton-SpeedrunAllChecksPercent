task 0 is simple, these commands are all quite similar though

task 1 for this one looking at the tile is enoguh, a whoami command

task 2 was not that hard either, there is a groups command after all

task 3 in this one we use a new command called chown, change owner

task 4 weve already done this before, just use touch

task 5 was trickier before, now just do +x and its done

task 6 is just another chmod add one

task 7 even easier than last

task 8 i remember when lucas cobham made a joke about the name of the task, shoutout to him
