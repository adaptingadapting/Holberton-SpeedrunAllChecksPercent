this is the project that contains the infamous water excercise, so i doubt i will be able to do it super fast, lets get started

task 0 simple use of the alias command

task 1 i did it with printf this time, expand the user variable

task 2 im sad that i doesmnt work in my local dir but it should be a reasonable solution

task 3 i thought i was original but this is the exact same solution i had on the original excersice, too bad
