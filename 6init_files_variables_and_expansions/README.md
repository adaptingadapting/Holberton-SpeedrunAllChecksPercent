this is the project that contains the infamous water excercise, so i doubt i will be able to do it super fast, lets get started

task 0 simple use of the alias command

task 1 i did it with printf this time, expand the user variable

task 2 im sad that i doesmnt work in my local dir but it should be a reasonable solution

task 3 i thought i was original but this is the exact same solution i had on the original excersice, too bad

task 4 in this one we just use one commmand, first time using printenv

task 5 simple use of the set  command, this command has no man page though so its a little annoying

task 6 is just setting a variable without export

task 7 in task 7 we do use the export keyword funnily enough

task 8 addition with expansion. funniliy enough my program doesnt work

task 9 more arithmetic
