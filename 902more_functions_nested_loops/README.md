README file for more functions nested loops directory

task 0 is very similar to the islower fucntion we did in the first functions nested loops one, this time just replace a and z for A and Z

task 1 i think i did this one in a more efficient manner this time

task 2 i just did it all in the return this time, no setting up a result variable saved me 2 lines

task 3 i feel like vie done this one before, but whatever here we go again

task 4 a simple logic statement there in the for loops sghould do enough

task 5 took me a few minutes, that modulus there was tricky to figure out but its done now

task 6 was rather simple, now these could get harder now

task 7 i think there might be better way to go about it but this solution took me around 5 minutes and its pretty good

task 8 was good, i tied doing it only setting up one varaible but cant just play around with n while you are using it for the other loop in a square sadly, so i set up and got it

task 9 i think this is the ultimate version of mine of fizz buzz, its pretty short and sweet and there is nothing extra from what i cant see, its the shortest version of it i have ever put out

task 10 was good, definetively a little tricky for me actually but still i got it pretty quick and nice, on to the advanced ones
