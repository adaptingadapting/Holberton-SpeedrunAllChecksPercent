README file for more functions nested loops directory

task 0 is very similar to the islower fucntion we did in the first functions nested loops one, this time just replace a and z for A and Z

task 1 i think i did this one in a more efficient manner this time

task 2 i just did it all in the return this time, no setting up a result variable saved me 2 lines

task 3 i feel like vie done this one before, but whatever here we go again

task 4 a simple logic statement there in the for loops sghould do enough

task 5 took me a few minutes, that modulus there was tricky to figure out but its done now

task 6 was rather simple, now these could get harder now

task 7 i think there might be better way to go about it but this solution took me around 5 minutes and its pretty good
