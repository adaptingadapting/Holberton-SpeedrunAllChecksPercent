creating readme for pointer arrays string repo, finally we are doing something i"interesintg"

task 0 once upon a time i had a hard time with this one i remember, everything burns

task 1 was also quite hard back then, but now its done and it took me around 2 minutes, writing everything included

task 2 ive done countless times really, so its become seocond nature these string functions, especially string lenght

task 3 i think i coulve done it easily with just write i have to say, maybe that just beoing lazy on my part

task 4 i combined strlen into this one and putchar and made a simple function i think this has to be a pretty good way to go about this

task 5 took me the longest, it was a silly little problem and i made it big sadly, but not that big, i managed in thirty minutes probably

task 6 took me only arounnd 4 minutes in comparision, so thats good
