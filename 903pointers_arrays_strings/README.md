creating readme for pointer arrays string repo, finally we are doing something i"interesintg"

task 0 once upon a time i had a hard time with this one i remember, everything burns

task 1 was also quite hard back then, but now its done and it took me around 2 minutes, writing everything included

task 2 ive done countless times really, so its become seocond nature these string functions, especially string lenght

task 3 i think i coulve done it easily with just write i have to say, maybe that just beoing lazy on my part

task 4 i combined strlen into this one and putchar and made a simple function i think this has to be a pretty good way to go about this

task 5 took me the longest, it was a silly little problem and i made it big sadly, but not that big, i managed in thirty minutes probably

task 6 took me only arounnd 4 minutes in comparision, so thats good

task 7 this one is another simple one really, not much to say

task 8 was simple as well, everything is simple when you can use printf

task 9 i thought this would be harder actuallly but its been done in a few minutes so thats good, on with the speedrun

task 100 cost me i think around an hour and a half maybe? the most ive spent in one of these for now and it makes sense i think, its not that easy and this is my first time doing it, im kinda of proud but i know the code can get alot cleaner, still, its done

task 0 was rather simple, its annoying that both these projects are in the same directory but whatever

task 1 again quite simple, this time i remembered to add the null character from the start
